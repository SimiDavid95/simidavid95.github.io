## About Me

Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Juan David Acosta, though you can call me either Juan or David, whichever name you prefer. My preferred pronouns are he/him/his. The purpose of this website is to showcase both my professional and personal sides. You will be able to peruse a more detailed version of my resume, read through data-driven reports that were part of my undergraduate coursework, and see my personal hobbies and topics beyond data and statistics that I love. A brief summary follows below:

I am a Colombian-Canadian currently living in the Greater Toronto Area, where I have completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto and received my Honours Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics, with minors in both Mathematics and the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology, in June 2022.

I have over a year of professional data analysis experience that took me into the renewables industry, on top of years of exposure to data analysis, statistical and mathematical concepts through my undergraduate studies. I have also taken courses that touched upon relevant topics today such as the ethics of developing artificial intelligence.

When I am not creating a ggplot or cleaning a dataset for analysis, you can find me cooking up tried and true recipes, catching up on my favourite shows (sci-fi is my absolute favourite genre!), looking up at the Moon through my telescope, or building cities on my computer.

Feel free to reach out to me through any of the social or email links that are present on this page. Thank you, and happy browsing!

**NOTE: This website is currently under development, so there may be some empty sections that will be filled in promptly.**
