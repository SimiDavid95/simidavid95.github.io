    "contents": "\r\nWordle is a game that has taken the world by storm, especially since it offered amusement and social connection in times of pandemic. The cryptic tiles and fractions inundated countless Twitter feeds. Thus, for my Day 3 blog post, I thought it would be fun to derive some summary statistics for my Wordle wins and recreate the bar plot that Wordle provides, and for even extra fun, I will show my process throughout by posting my R code! Let’s do this!\r\nFirst, an important step is to always initialize the packages we will need for the task at hand. Since we will concern ourselves with crafting aesthetically-pleasing graphs, we will deploy the power of the Tidyverse to use the ggplot2 graphing package. Since I will be entering the data manually, there is no need for a seed to ensure reproducibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Load in necessary library.\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond, let’s create our data. Wordle tracks statistics such as the number of games played and the guess distribution (i.e. how many games were won with one guess, two guesses, …, six guesses). These are the\r\n\r\n\r\n# Variable with number of games won, which is also the number of games played.\r\ngames_won <- 88\r\n\r\n# Create new variable called \"guesses\" that will store the Wordle wins based on how many guesses \r\n# it took to guess the correct word, with numerical values ranging from 2 to 6.\r\nguesses <- c(2, rep(3, 19), rep(4, 36), rep(5, 25), rep(6, 7))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThird, let’s run some summary statistics on our Wordle data, such as the mean number of guesses it took to correctly guess the word of the day, the variance and standard deviation for the number of guesses, and the percentage for each of the number of guesses out of the total number of games won.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Preliminary work that groups the number of guesses in a tibble, and counts the number of occurrences for each number of guesses.\r\ngrouped_guesses_table <- tibble(one_guess = 0,\r\n                        two_guesses = sum(guesses == 2),\r\n                        three_guesses = sum(guesses == 3),\r\n                        four_guesses = sum(guesses == 4),\r\n                        five_guesses = sum(guesses == 5),\r\n                        six_guesses = sum(guesses == 6))\r\n\r\n## Represent as kable.\r\ngrouped_guesses_kable <- knitr::kable(grouped_guesses_table,\r\n                                      col.names = c(\"One guess\", \"Two guesses\", \"Three guesses\",\r\n                                                    \"Four guesses\", \"Five guesses\", \"Six guesses\"),\r\n                                      caption = \"Sum for each number of guesses.\")\r\ngrouped_guesses_kable\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1: Sum for each number of guesses.\r\nOne guess\r\nTwo guesses\r\nThree guesses\r\nFour guesses\r\nFive guesses\r\nSix guesses\r\n0\r\n1\r\n19\r\n36\r\n25\r\n7\r\n\r\n# Percentages for each of the number of guesses out of the total number of games won.\r\npercentage_guesses_table <- tibble(one_guess = 0,\r\n                                   two_guesses = (sum(guesses == 2) / games_won) * 100,\r\n                                   three_guesses = (sum(guesses == 3) / games_won) * 100,\r\n                                   four_guesses = (sum(guesses == 4) / games_won) * 100,\r\n                                   five_guesses = (sum(guesses == 5) / games_won) * 100,\r\n                                   six_guesses = (sum(guesses == 6) / games_won) * 100)\r\n\r\n## Round percentages to two decimal points in percentage_guesses_table.\r\npercentage_guesses_table <- round(percentage_guesses_table, 2)\r\n\r\n## Represent as kable.\r\npercentage_guesses_kable <- knitr::kable(percentage_guesses_table,\r\n                                         col.names = c(\"One guess\", \"Two guesses\", \"Three guesses\",\r\n                                                    \"Four guesses\", \"Five guesses\", \"Six guesses\"),\r\n                                         caption = \"Percentage (%) of each number of guesses out of the total number of guesses.\")\r\npercentage_guesses_kable\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1: Percentage (%) of each number of guesses out of the total number of guesses.\r\nOne guess\r\nTwo guesses\r\nThree guesses\r\nFour guesses\r\nFive guesses\r\nSix guesses\r\n0\r\n1.14\r\n21.59\r\n40.91\r\n28.41\r\n7.95\r\n\r\n# Calculate mean for the number of guesses, and round to two decimal places.\r\nmean_guesses <- round(mean(guesses), 2)\r\n\r\n# Calculate variance for the number of guesses, and round to two decimal places.\r\nvar_guesses <- round(var(guesses), 2)\r\n\r\n# Calculate standard deviation for the number of guesses, and round to two decimal places.\r\nsd_guesses <- round(sd(guesses), 2)\r\n\r\n# Place the mean, variance, and standard deviation in a tibble.\r\nmean_var_sd_guesses <- tibble(mean_guesses,\r\n                              var_guesses,\r\n                              sd_guesses)\r\n\r\n## Represent as kable.\r\nmean_var_sd_kable <- knitr::kable(mean_var_sd_guesses,\r\n                                  col.names = c(\"Mean\", \"Variance\", \"Standard deviation\"),\r\n                                  caption = \"Mean, variance and standard deviation for number of guesses.\")\r\nmean_var_sd_kable\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1: Mean, variance and standard deviation for number of guesses.\r\nMean\r\nVariance\r\nStandard deviation\r\n4.2\r\n0.83\r\n0.91\r\n\r\nFourth, it’s time for the graph! We’ll create a bar graph, similar to the one that Wordle provides.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Preliminary work to make a one-column tibble from the original guesses vector.\r\nguesses_table <- tibble(guesses)\r\n\r\n# Create bar chart.\r\nbar_guesses <- guesses_table %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(guesses))) +\r\n  geom_bar(fill = \"#66CC33\") +\r\n  labs(title = \"Wordle Guess Distribution\",\r\n       caption = \"Created by Juan David Acosta using personal Wordle statistics.\") +\r\n  xlab(\"Number of guesses to correctly guess word\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\r\n  theme_minimal()\r\nbar_guesses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there we have it! You can recreate your own Wordle guess distribution bar graph using the code above, simply updating some of the code above with your own data.\r\nThat’s a wrap on today’s post!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n (Photo by Akil Mazumder: https://www.pexels.com/photo/person-holding-a-green-plant-1072824/)\r\nToday is Earth Day. A day when we reflect upon the state of our planet. With the climate crisis we are facing today, it can seem that the future is bleak, especially for the young generations that will face the brunt force of a warmer planet. However, I would like to highlight the positives, the reasons to have hope that, while we may not be able to prevent all the consequences of climate change, we can at least unite together to mitigate the most harmful outcomes. We have become more conscious of our impact on the well-being of Earth’s diverse biosphere, and are taking steps to help in any way we can to reduce that impact, whether it be buying an electric vehicle, shopping with reusable bags, planting trees, recycling, etc. It is not futile. It is not too late. Through hope and action, we can help preserve the only planet that we call home, Earth.\r\nPivoting from Earth Day, I have decided to continue posting at least one blog a day, every day! There are no guarantees for this, but I am striving to keep this up as not only an exercise in writing, but also in communicating my thoughts and ideas to the world. Thus, it will be an integral part of this website. And speaking of the website, major progress has been made in building out the rest of the website’s sections. Of course, this will be a continuing endeavour as time progresses.\r\nThat’s a wrap for this post!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nBuilding a website seems to be one of the fundamental basics that one must have at this point in the 21st century. A website for your business. A website for your portfolio of projects. I had attempted to make websites in the past, mostly for the times I had considered becoming a content creator, or when I fell for the allure and ease-of-use of Apple’s iWeb (this is where I date myself), but those endeavours quickly fell apart. It was a combination of no clear focus for those websites, and the amount of time that I would have to spend on them.\r\nNow, however, I have found a purpose for building a website. I am looking to break ground on my future career as a data analyst or data scientist, and it is imperative to have a central, aesthetically-pleasing looking place to highlight my projects and competencies, as well as my thoughts (like through this here blog) and ways to get in contact with me. Thus, a website is a must. And, with my intermediate knowledge of R and RStudio, what better way to put that knowledge into practice than by building a website using both R and RStudio?\r\nThus, this journey started. After consulting various articles and tutorials (that will eventually be linked here once the site is a bit more polished), the website has officially made its internet debut! There’s nothing too fancy here at the moment, but it shall soon be filled to the brim with more blog posts, projects (such as my educational projects and Tidy Tuesday submissions), biography, contact information, etc. So please, grab some snacks and drinks that I’ve set out on the table there, and take a look around!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
