I am quick to learn new topics, and have a meticulous attention to detail. Through my experiences, I have developed a data-driven way of thinking that allows me to effectively wrangle, analyze and visualize data, gathering valuable data-driven insights, and communicating those results effectively so that relevant stakeholders may act upon them.\r\nWork Experience\r\nHeliolytics Inc. - Toronto, ONData Analyst and Report Specialist (Junior and Senior Level) - July 2022 to August 2023\r\nThis was my first full-time professional role. Starting as a junior analyst (Data Analyst and Report Specialist), there were several tasks I could be found working on from day to day. I onboarded client assets into the company’s internal systems to prepare for analysis. I performed analysis on the infrared and visual imagery captured from solar power generation sites, translating performance issues observed on site into fault data inputted into the company’s proprietary internal analysis systems, as well as noting down key trends on site for further investigation from the client. I generated reports and other deliverables from the insights extracted from the data analysis so that clients can perform remediation on their sites, optimizing their performance. When I was promoted to the senior analyst position (Data Analyst 2), I was also tasked with reviewing the analyses of junior analysts to ensure marking rules and strategies were followed.\r\nThis role also gave me valuable experience in project management. I acted as a project manager by managing several client portfolios totaling approximately 240MWdc of energy output and ensuring their sites flowed smoothly through the analysis pipeline.\r\nFinally, I was also the owner of several initiatives on the analysis team, including: updating a repository of analysis tips and tricks; a co-authored guide that laid out best practices for project managers that handled client portfolios of multiple sites; an automated system implemented in our project management software that moved sites from one section to another based on their status change, considerably reducing the time it would take to do this manually and allowed project managers to keep better track of their sites.\r\nInsurtech Advisors - Toronto, ONData Analytics and Reporting Intern - March 2022\r\nThis internship was part of the Riipen Level UP virtual internship program. My supervisor tasked me with building a program to estimate the number of boats that appeared in a given satellite image. This involved researching computer vision methods, which exposed me to machine learning and artificial intelligence processes and functions. I completed the program within the month-long time frame of my internship, and the final deliverable consisted of the program, which was written in RStudio using both R and Python code, as well as a PDF report where I communicated the results of the project, written in RMarkdown. My supervisor left me a 5-star rating and review on the Riipen portal (link).\r\nUniversity of Toronto - Toronto, ONOnline Course Moderator - September 2020 to April 2021\r\nI was tasked with assisting in the running of online courses for the Translational Research Program of the Temerty Faculty of Medicine in the University of Toronto. Using my technical skills, I assisted instructors and students with the technical aspects of the Zoom videoconferencing software and troubleshooting. This included performing functions such as setting up breakout rooms for group discussions, setting up polls as part of in-class activities, and troubleshooting audio and visual issues. In addition to this, I was also tasked with logging course participation and managing class recordings.\r\nUniversity of Toronto - Toronto, ONAdministrative Assistant - September 2019 to February 2020\r\nI was tasked with assisting in the running of the program office of the Department of Psychiatry of the Temerty Faculty of Medicine in the University of Toronto. This position exposed me to both data analysis and data management processes, such as data entry, data verification, and data cleaning. I assisted in updating student and faculty records on a specialized departmental website. I also collaborated on a project to update the repository of course and residency listings, which received positive feedback from students and residents.\r\nEducation\r\nUndergraduate\r\nUniversity of Toronto - Toronto, ONHonours Bachelor of Science - June 2022\r\nMajor in Statistics:\r\nProbability and sampling design\r\nStatistical distributions\r\nVarious types of regression (linear, logistic, etc.)\r\nTime series analysis\r\nData analysis\r\nObservational studies\r\nExperimental design\r\nEthical considerations and reproducibility\r\nStatistical programming using R\r\nData analytic consulting\r\nMinor in Mathematics:\r\nUnivariate and multivariate calculus\r\nLinear algebra\r\nMinor in History and Philosophy of Science and Technology:\r\nHistory of mathematics\r\nHistory of probability\r\nEthics of machine learning and artificial intelligence\r\nTechnical Skills\r\nProgramming and database languages\r\nR\r\nThis is the programming language I am most proficient in, as I have used it in several statistics courses for projects and assignments.

My elementary book list consisted of several books on the Moon and the Solar System as a whole. As a young adult, I invested in a home telescope, where I’ve observed the Moon and various stars on several occasions, and even got to observe Mars once. It was a faint red dot, even with the power of the telescope’s magnification, but it was still awe-inducing to realize that I was staring at another planet in real time. I have taken several undergraduate courses on the Solar System, the universe in general, and astrobiology. I have also invested several hours into playing Stellaris, which is a space simulation game where you build out a spacefaring civilization. Astronomy has given me experience in another scientific field, and helped me work on my analytical skills.\r\nCooking\r\nRecently, I have endeavoured to become more proficient in the kitchen, and this has involved both learning new recipes and practicing recipes handed down to me by my mom and other family members. Several dishes that I have made include chicken parmesan (my signature dish), American breakfast, creamy chicken penne pasta, salmon glazed in a honey-lemon-soy sauce, and more. Cooking exercises my attention to detail when following recipes, but also my creativity when I modify recipes to experiment.\r\nEurovision Song Contest\r\nI was introduced to the Eurovision Song Contest in 2018 by a close friend, and since then I’ve been a big Eurofan that hasn’t missed the contest live. Favourite countries I look out for each year are Belgium and the United Kingdom.\r\nTitanic\r\nHands-down my favourite movie of all time has to be 1997’s “Titanic”. Since I was 2 years old, I have probably watched that movie at least a dozen times, if not more. The fascination with the movie also spilled over into a fascination with the real-life ship itself, diving deeper into the tragedy and also becoming a general ocean liner fan. You can find several books on Titanic in my bookshelf.\r\nSimulated city-building\r\nI have invested hours into Cities: Skylines, a simulation game in which you are tasked with building out a city, taking it from an empty plot of land to a bustling metropolis. This game heavily exercises my creativity when it comes to planning the layout of my cities, and it has also taught me how to strategize in order to keep a budget and manage traffic.\r\nTabletop roleplaying games\r\nI have gotten to play in several tabletop roleplaying games, where you roleplay as a character that you create (or one that is pre-generated for you), telling a story either on your own or with a group of other players, usually with a game master that facilitates the narrative. I also enjoy watching them through both livestreams and pre-recorded videos. Playing in these games has helped me develop teamwork when roleplaying with a group and collaborating in the storytelling.\r\nWiki editing\r\nI have helped edit and create a majority of the structure of the Saving Throw Show wiki as it is today. I am also the administrator for the wiki, which means that I am given access to the underlying administrative tools, such as the wiki analytics and structural edits. Wiki editing and administering has given me technical practice in working on a website, creating a structure and making edits, as well as analyzing data and trends for wiki visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

(There are mutations where more or less than five leaves grow at a time on one stem, but for the purposes of simplification, these rare cases are left out of the experiment.) The money tree, like many plants, thrives on an abundance of sunlight, regular fertilization, plenty of water, and a relatively big plant pot to grow its roots.\r\nThis study aims to identify the effect of hours exposed to direct sunlight per day, whether or not fertilizer was used, the number of waterings in a month, and the plant pot size on the number of new leaves that sprout on a money tree in a month. A replicated fractional factorial experimental design was deemed the most appropriate for the task at hand, because the factors are each divided into two (binary) levels. The design is a \\(2^{4-1}\\) fractional factorial design, where eight runs (each with a different combination of factors) were replicated four times for a total of 32 runs. The statistical analysis consists of factorial effect estimates, which were obtained by employing a linear model, and these estimates encompass the main and interaction effects of the experiment. The Normal, Half-Normal, and Lenth plots were also analysed.\r\nThe conclusion reveals that it cannot be conclusively determined that any of the factors or interactions were significant to the growth of the money tree leaves, which goes against the initial hypothesis that the factors and interactions would be significant. A future study can run this same experiment using a modified experimental design to determine if the same conclusions will arise or not.\r\nCode and PDF\r\nThe code for this project, which is an Rmd file, can be found here: Code\r\nThe PDF report for this project can be found here: Report\r\nToronto Traffic During Pandemic Observational Study\r\nAbstract\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affected many aspects of our lives, including commuting habits. As lockdowns were introduced around the world, including in the Canadian city of Toronto, traffic levels dropped significantly for all modes of travel. As the pandemic progressed, there were also shifts in travel preferences, where more Torontonians preferred to get around by walking or riding a bike as opposed to driving or taking public transit.\r\nThis report investigates whether the number of cars per cyclist/pedestrian that travel through intersections in Toronto increased, decreased, or stayed the same as the pandemic progressed. Data was obtained from the Toronto Open Data portal and was cleaned, analyzed and plotted to perform exploratory data analysis. The data was fit to a multiple linear regression model in order to project the data into the future, and the model predicts that the number of cars per cyclist/pedestrian will increase given the effects of the independent variables.\r\nThe conclusion reveals that as that as the pandemic progresses, the number of cars per cyclist/pedestrian will increase, which is consistent with the lifting of lockdown and pandemic measures, which will contribute to traffic levels normalizing as more residents of Toronto go back to their in-person jobs, and more businesses either reopen or reduce their pandemic restrictions. However, the data does show that the early period of the pandemic led to a slight decrease of cars per cyclist/pedestrian, pointing to more residents preferring to either walk or bike as opposed to drive. This information can be used by the city to promote ambitions plans to expand cycling infrastructure and increase pedestrian walking spaces, in order to promote these modes of transportation and exercise.\r\nCode, PDF and Cleaned Data\r\nThe code for this project, which is an Rmd file, can be found here: Code\r\nThe PDF report for this project can be found here: Report\r\nThe cleaned data for this project can be found here: Cleaned data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
