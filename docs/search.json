However, this meteoric rise in AI development and use has made me think about the ethical implications of AI and the most responsible way to develop and use this promising technology. I am looking to grow both my knowledge of how AI works, as well as the current literature on AI ethics.\r\nAstronomy\r\nSince I was a child, I have always been fascinated by space. My elementary book list consisted of several books on the Moon and the Solar System as a whole. As a young adult, I invested in a home telescope, where I’ve observed the Moon and various stars on several occasions, and even got to observe Mars once. It was a faint red dot, even with the power of the telescope’s magnification, but it was still awe-inducing to realize that I was staring at another planet in real time. I have taken several undergraduate courses on the Solar System, the universe in general, and astrobiology. I have also invested several hours into playing Stellaris, which is a space simulation game where you build out a spacefaring civilization. Astronomy has given me experience in another scientific field, and helped me work on my analytic skills.\r\nEurovision Song Contest\r\nI was introduced to the Eurovision Song Contest in 2018 by a close friend, and since then I’ve been a big Eurofan that hasn’t missed the contest live. Favourite countries I look out for each year are Belgium and the United Kingdom.\r\nSimulated city-building\r\nI have invested hours into Cities: Skylines, a city-building simulation game in which you are tasked with building out and managing a city, taking it from an empty plot of land to a bustling metropolis. This game heavily exercises my creativity when it comes to planning the layout of my cities, and it has also taught me how to strategize in order to keep a budget and manage traffic.\r\nTabletop roleplaying games\r\nI have gotten to play in several tabletop roleplaying games, where you roleplay as a character that you create (or one that is pre-generated for you), telling a story either on your own or with a group of other players, usually with a game master that facilitates the narrative. I also enjoy watching them through both livestreams and pre-recorded videos. Playing in these games has helped me develop teamwork when roleplaying with a group and collaborating in the storytelling.\r\nTitanic\r\nHands-down my favourite movie of all time has to be 1997’s “Titanic”. Since I was 2 years old, I have probably watched that movie at least a dozen times, if not more. The fascination with the movie also spilled over into a fascination with the real-life ship itself, diving deeper into the tragedy and also becoming a general ocean liner fan. You can find several books on Titanic in my bookshelf.\r\nWiki editing\r\nI have helped edit and create a majority of the structure of the Saving Throw Show wiki as it is today. The wiki is a repository of information for all of the shows, cast and characters that have appeared on the Saving Throw Show actual play network. I am also the administrator for the wiki, which means that I am given access to the underlying administrative tools, such as the wiki analytics and structural edits. Wiki editing and administering has given me technical practice in working on a website, creating a structure and making edits, as well as analyzing data and trends for wiki visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

(There are mutations where more or less than five leaves grow at a time on one stem, but for the purposes of simplification, these rare cases are left out of the experiment.) The money tree, like many plants, thrives on an abundance of sunlight, regular fertilization, plenty of water, and a relatively big plant pot to grow its roots.\r\nThis study aims to identify the effect of hours exposed to direct sunlight per day, whether or not fertilizer was used, the number of waterings in a month, and the plant pot size on the number of new leaves that sprout on a money tree in a month. A replicated fractional factorial experimental design was deemed the most appropriate for the task at hand, because the factors are each divided into two (binary) levels. The design is a \\(2^{4-1}\\) fractional factorial design, where eight runs (each with a different combination of factors) were replicated four times for a total of 32 runs. The statistical analysis consists of factorial effect estimates, which were obtained by employing a linear model, and these estimates encompass the main and interaction effects of the experiment. The Normal, Half-Normal, and Lenth plots were also analysed.\r\nThe conclusion reveals that it cannot be conclusively determined that any of the factors or interactions were significant to the growth of the money tree leaves, which goes against the initial hypothesis that the factors and interactions would be significant. A future study can run this same experiment using a modified experimental design to determine if the same conclusions will arise or not.\r\nCode and PDF\r\nThe code for this project, which is an Rmd file, can be found here: Code\r\nThe PDF report for this project can be found here: Report\r\nToronto Traffic During Pandemic Observational Study\r\nAbstract\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affected many aspects of our lives, including commuting habits. As lockdowns were introduced around the world, including in the Canadian city of Toronto, traffic levels dropped significantly for all modes of travel. As the pandemic progressed, there were also shifts in travel preferences, where more Torontonians preferred to get around by walking or riding a bike as opposed to driving or taking public transit.\r\nThis report investigates whether the number of cars per cyclist/pedestrian that travel through intersections in Toronto increased, decreased, or stayed the same as the pandemic progressed. Data was obtained from the Toronto Open Data portal and was cleaned, analyzed and plotted to perform exploratory data analysis. The data was fit to a multiple linear regression model in order to project the data into the future, and the model predicts that the number of cars per cyclist/pedestrian will increase given the effects of the independent variables.\r\nThe conclusion reveals that as that as the pandemic progresses, the number of cars per cyclist/pedestrian will increase, which is consistent with the lifting of lockdown and pandemic measures, which will contribute to traffic levels normalizing as more residents of Toronto go back to their in-person jobs, and more businesses either reopen or reduce their pandemic restrictions. However, the data does show that the early period of the pandemic led to a slight decrease of cars per cyclist/pedestrian, pointing to more residents preferring to either walk or bike as opposed to drive. This information can be used by the city to promote ambitions plans to expand cycling infrastructure and increase pedestrian walking spaces, in order to promote these modes of transportation and exercise.\r\nCode, PDF and Cleaned Data\r\nThe code for this project, which is an Rmd file, can be found here: Code\r\nThe PDF report for this project can be found here: Report\r\nThe cleaned data for this project can be found here: Cleaned data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
