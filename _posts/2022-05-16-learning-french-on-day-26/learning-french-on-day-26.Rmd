It has been a few days since I started practicing my French again. I've only ever had classroom-level French from what I learned throughout elementary school and part of high school, and now I want to expand my knowledge of the language in order to better hold a conversation in French and to eventually become fluent. This is very beneficial in Canada since we are officially a bilingual country where English and French are the two official languages. I am already bilingual in English and Spanish, and adding French to the mix would open more doors for me.

That's a wrap on today's post!
