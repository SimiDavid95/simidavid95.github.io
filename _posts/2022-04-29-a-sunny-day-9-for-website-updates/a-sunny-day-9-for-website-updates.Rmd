The sunshine has finally come our way here in Toronto, and along with it are more updates to the website. The "Beyond the Data" section has been filled out, and images should be added soon to give the page a bit more flair. It's been a fun section to work on, because I get to highlight parts of my life that may not be apparent from a resume. Completing this section also means that all the major sections of the website now have content! This website will continually be updated, with new blog and Tidy Tuesday entries, educational projects that I still have to modify to publicly share them, other projects (including one currently in the works!), and updates to my resume as they come.

That's a wrap on today's post!
