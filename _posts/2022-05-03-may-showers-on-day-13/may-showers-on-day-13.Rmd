One of the things I love about spring is the constant rain showers. There's something calming and soothing about the rain, especially when one can be inside, staring out through a window. I took the chance to have a calm day by dedicating myself to organizing my thoughts and plans for the near-future. This included mapping out my career goals and what I need to do to achieve them. I have also set myself up to continue learning French, taking online courses to boost my skills, and taking up more leisure reading. I am also striving to set aside a part of my day for meditation. Rainy days truly are wonderful days.

That's a wrap on today's post!
