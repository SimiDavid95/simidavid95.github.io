This is my work-in-progress personal website. Here, I will endeavor to add the following sections:

## Home

A landing page that gives a general overview of the website and all its sections. May also be used as the **About** page.

## Resume

A more detailed version of my resume, including a more in-depth explanation of competencies and experiences, including links to relevant projects.

## Projects

A section for all my projects, both educational ones that I have adapted to share online, and personal projects such as Tidy Tuesday submissions. This section will have the following subsections: **Educational Projects**, **Tidy Tuesday**, **Other Projects**.

## Blog

A blog detailing my journey building this website, as well as possibly discussing both stats and non-stats topics.

## Beyond the Stats

A summary of my personal hobbies and activities outside the realms of statistics, data analysis and data science.

## Connect

Ways to connect with me, including Twitter and GitHub.
