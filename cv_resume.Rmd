## Overview

I am a reliable, energetic, and resourceful individual with more than a year of diverse work experience, including six months of administrative experience with an emphasis on data management, eight months of online moderation experience working in a virtual setting, and a month-long virtual internship putting into practice my data analytics and research skills. These various experiences, along with the analytic and critical thinking skills I have acquired in my undergraduate education, allow me to adapt quickly to any new job or task.

## Work Experience

**Insurtech Advisors** - *Toronto, ON*\
**Data Analytics and Reporting Intern** - March 2022

This internship was part of the Riipen Level UP virtual internship program. My supervisor tasked me with building a program to estimate the number of boats that appeared in a given satellite image. This involved researching computer vision methods, which exposed me to machine learning and artificial intelligence processes and functions. I completed the program within the month-long time frame of my internship, and the final deliverable consisted of the program, which was written in RStudio using both R and Python code, as well as a PDF report where I communicated the results of the project, written in RMarkdown. My supervisor left me a 5-star rating and review on the Riipen portal ([link](https://app.riipen.com/users/vO24BjLQ/feedbacks?preserve=false&scroll=false)).

**University of Toronto** - *Toronto, ON*\
**Online Course Moderator** - September 2020 to April 2021

I was tasked with assisting in the running of online courses for the Translational Research Program of the Temerty Faculty of Medicine in the University of Toronto. Using my technical skills, I assisted instructors and students with the technical aspects of the Zoom videoconferencing software and troubleshooting. This included performing functions such as setting up breakout rooms for group discussions, setting up polls as part of in-class activities, and troubleshooting audio and visual issues. In addition to this, I was also tasked with logging course participation and managing class recordings.

**University of Toronto** - *Toronto, ON*\
**Administrative Assistant** - September 2019 to February 2020

I was tasked with assisting in the running of the program office of the Department of Psychiatry of the Temerty Faculty of Medicine in the University of Toronto. This position exposed me to both data analysis and data management processes, such as data entry, data verification, and data cleaning. I assisted in updating student and faculty records on a specialized departmental website. I also collaborated on a project to update the repository of course and residency listings, which received positive feedback from students and residents.
